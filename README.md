# Notes Challenge

## This Week's Task
By the end of the week your goal is to be able to say:

* I can build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.
* I can request and use data from an external API.
* I can explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.

## User Stories
```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```
```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```
```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```
```
As a programmer
I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ðŸ”¥
So I can record notes with fun little pictures
```

### Concepts
